# Doppler Effect Model
  A simulation that shows the change of color as a star moves towards and away from the observer. 

# Usage
  Adjust the slider to change the velocity (km/s) and the color of the star will change from blue (negative velocity) to red (positive velocity). Or input the value into the box to see the color change, if the input is not between -100 to 100 or isn't a valid number then an alert will pop up.
